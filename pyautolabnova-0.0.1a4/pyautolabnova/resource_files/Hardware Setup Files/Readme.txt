If Nova is installed on the PC you can adjust the Hardware setup
with Nova.

The HardwareSetup files provided in this folder can be used as a
start for building SDK applications. If you want to perform FRA 
measurements with the FRA2 module, the proper Fra Calibration data file 
should be loaded. This can be done with the Hardware Setup option of
Nova. Better is to use the HardwareSetup file provided with your
instrument (from the Nova CD) or from the following folders:

For Windows XP:
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Metrohm Autolab\11.0

For Windows Vista and Windows 7 and 8:
C:\ProgramData\Metrohm Autolab\11.0

(11.0 is for Nova 1.10, later version will have different folders)

The files saved in these folders will have the Autolab serialnumber 
included in the filename (i.e. HardwareSetup.AUT81234.xml)

These folders are hidden for the default user but can be addressed 
by copying the path into the Explorer.

These folders can only be accessed if you have Administrator rights.
